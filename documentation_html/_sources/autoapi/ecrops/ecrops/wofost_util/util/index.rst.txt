.. py:function:: reference_ET(DAY, LAT, ELEV, TMIN, TMAX, IRRAD, VAP, WIND, ANGSTA, ANGSTB, ATMTR, ANGOT, ETMODEL='PM', **kwargs)

   Calculates reference evapotranspiration values E0, ES0 and ET0.

       The open water (E0) and bare soil evapotranspiration (ES0) are calculated with
       the modified Penman approach, while the references canopy evapotranspiration is
       calculated with the modified Penman or the Penman-Monteith approach, the latter
       is the default.

       Input variables::

           DAY     -  Python datetime.date object                      -

           ETMODEL -  Indicates if the canopy reference ET should     PM|P
                      be calculated with the Penman-Monteith method
                      (PM) or the modified Penman method (P)

       Output is a tuple (E0, ES0, ET0)::

           E0      -  Penman potential evaporation from a free
                      water surface [cm/d]
           ES0     -  Penman potential evaporation from a moist
                      bare soil surface [cm/d]
           ET0     -  Penman or Penman-Monteith potential evapotranspiration from a
                      crop canopy [cm/d]

   .. note:: The Penman-Monteith algorithm is valid only for a reference canopy and
       therefore it is not used to calculate the reference values for bare soil and
       open water (ES0, E0).

       The background is that the Penman-Monteith model is basically a surface
       energy balance where the net solar radiation is partitioned over latent and
       sensible heat fluxes (ignoring the soil heat flux). To estimate this
       partitioning, the PM method makes a connection between the surface
       temperature and the air temperature. However, the assumptions
       underlying the PM model are valid only when the surface where this
       partitioning takes place is the same for the latent and sensible heat
       fluxes.

       For a crop canopy this assumption is valid because the leaves of the
       canopy form the surface where both latent heat flux (through stomata)
       and sensible heat flux (through leaf temperature) are partitioned.
       For a soil, this principle does not work because when the soil is
       drying the evaporation front will quickly disappear below the surface
       and therefore the assumption that the partitioning surface is the
       same does not hold anymore.

       For water surfaces, the assumptions underlying PM do not hold
       because there is no direct relationship between the temperature
       of the water surface and the net incoming radiation as radiation is
       absorbed by the water column and the temperature of the water surface
       is co-determined by other factors (mixing, etc.). Only for a very
       shallow layer of water (1 cm) the PM methodology could be applied.

       For bare soil and open water the Penman model is preferred. Although it
       partially suffers from the same problems, it is calibrated somewhat
       better for open water and bare soil based on its empirical wind
       function.

       Finally, in crop simulation models the open water evaporation and
       bare soil evaporation only play a minor role (pre-sowing conditions
       and flooded rice at early stages), it is not worth investing much
       effort in improved estimates of reference value for E0 and ES0.
