.. py:function:: totass(DAYL, AMAX, EFF, LAI, KDIF, AVRAD, DIFPP, DSINBE, SINLD, COSLD)

   This routine calculates the daily total gross CO2 assimilation by performing a Gaussian integration over
   time. At three different times of the day, irradiance is computed and used to calculate the instantaneous
   canopy assimilation, whereafter integration takes place. More information on this routine is given by Spitters et
   al. (1988).

.. py:function:: assim(AMAX, EFF, LAI, KDIF, SINB, PARDIR, PARDIF)

   This routine calculates the gross CO2 assimilation rate of the whole crop, FGROS, by performing a Gaussian
   integration over depth in the crop canopy. At three different depths in the canopy, i.e. for different values of
   LAI, the assimilation rate is computed for given fluxes of photosynthetically active radiation, whereafter
   integration over depth takes place. More information on this routine is given by Spitters et al. (1988). The
   input variables SINB, PARDIR and PARDIF are calculated in routine TOTASS. Subroutines and functions called: none.
   Called by routine TOTASS.

.. py:class:: WOFOST_Assimilation

   Bases: :py:obj:`ecrops.Step.Step`

   This step implements a WOFOST/SUCROS style assimilation routine.

   WOFOST calculates the daily gross CO2 assimilation rate of a crop from the absorbed radiation and the
   photosynthesis-light response curve of individual leaves. This response is dependent on temperature and leaf age.
   The absorbed radiation is calculated from the total incoming radiation and the leaf area. Daily gross CO2
   assimilation is obtained by integrating the assimilation rates over the leaf layers and over the day.
