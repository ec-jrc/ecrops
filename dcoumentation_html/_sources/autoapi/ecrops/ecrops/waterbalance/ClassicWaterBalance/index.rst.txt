   Bases: :py:obj:`ecrops.Step.Step`

   Classic mono layer water balance for freely draining soils under water-limited production.

   The purpose of the soil water balance calculations is to estimate the
   daily value of the soil moisture content. The soil moisture content
   influences soil moisture uptake and crop transpiration.

   The dynamic calculations are carried out in two sections, one for the
   calculation of rates of change per timestep (= 1 day) and one for the
   calculation of summation variables and state variables. The water balance
   is driven by rainfall, possibly buffered as surface storage, and
   evapotranspiration. The processes considered are infiltration, soil water
   retention, percolation (here conceived as downward water flow from rooted
   zone to second layer), and the loss of water beyond the maximum root zone.

   The textural profile of the soil is conceived as homogeneous. Initially the
   soil profile consists of two layers, the actually rooted  soil and the soil
   immediately below the rooted zone until the maximum rooting depth (soil and
   crop dependent). The extension of the root zone from initial rooting depth
   to maximum rooting depth is described in Root_Dynamics class. From the
   moment that the maximum rooting depth is reached the soil profile is
   described as a one layer system. The class WaterbalanceFD is derived
   from WATFD.FOR in WOFOST7.1
