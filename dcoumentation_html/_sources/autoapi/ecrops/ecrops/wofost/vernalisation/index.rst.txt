   Modification of phenological development due to vernalisation.

   The vernalization approach here is based on the work of Lenny van Bussel
   (2011), which in turn is based on Wang and Engel (1998). The basic
   principle is that winter wheat needs a certain number of days with temperatures
   within an optimum temperature range to complete its vernalisation
   requirement. Until the vernalisation requirement is fulfilled, the crop
   development is delayed.

   The rate of vernalization (VERNR) is defined by the temperature response
   function VERNRTB. Within the optimal temperature range 1 day is added
   to the vernalisation state (VERN). The reduction on the phenological
   development is calculated from the base and saturated vernalisation
   requirements (VERNBASE and VERNSAT). The reduction factor (VERNFAC) is
   scaled linearly between VERNBASE and VERNSAT.

   A critical development stage (VERNDVS) is used to stop the effect of
   vernalisation when this DVS is reached. This is done to improve model
   stability in order to avoid that Anthesis is never reached due to a
   somewhat too high VERNSAT. Nevertheless, a warning is written to the log
   file, if this happens.
